## Developing 
This repository uses monorepo approach by relying on `go.work`. It contains list of directories that are
currently *being worked on* in this project. It helps editors locate function definitions, modules, and more. 
If you want to focus developing certain service, you could just make the list only contains `lib` and the 
service path. 

## Deploying
You could deploy this project in:

<details>
  <summary>monolith</summary>

  ![codebase-structure](./_docs/monolith.png)

  Run every service on a single container by:

  - Ensure `monolith/Dockerfile` populates container's `go.work` with path of every directory with `go.mod` on it
  - Ensure `docker-compose.yaml` uses every `.env` on it (the env had prefixed by service, so you don't need to worry about conflict)
  - Ensure `docker-compose.yaml` uses `monolith/` Dockerfile
  - Select build `target` you want and run it: `docker compose up -d` (add `--build` to force rebuild)
</details>

<details>
  <summary>microservices</summary>

  ![codebase-structure](./_docs/microservice.png)

  Run every service on their own container by:

  - Ensure `<service>/Dockerfile` populates container's `go.work` with `lib` and `<service>` path
  - Ensure `docker-compose.yaml` uses service's `.env` on it (the env had prefixed by service, so you don't need to worry about conflict)
  - Ensure `docker-compose.yaml` uses `<service>/` Dockerfile
  - Select build `target` you want and run it: `docker compose up -d` (add `--build` to force rebuild)
</details>

<details>
  <summary>hybrid</summary>

  ![codebase-structure](./_docs/hybrid.png)

  Run some in single container while the others are on their own by:

  - Create `1 + n` containers where `n` is the number of services you want to run independently
  - Do the monolith steps, but leave out the services that you want to run independently
  - Do the microservice steps for every service you want to run independently
  - Run it: `docker compose up -d` (add `--build` to force rebuild)
</details>
